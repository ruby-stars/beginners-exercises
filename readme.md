Beginners Exercises
--

This repository contains exercises for the beginners group.

Each folder represens a subject, inside them there's a `readme.md` file containing the actual exercises and a `solutions/` folder with the possible solutions.

The solutions files are called `exercise_<number_for_solution>.rb`. To run these solutions you can do so by typing `ruby <topic_folder>/solutions/exercise_<number_for_solution>.rb`.

i.e:

```bash
    # In your terminal, inside this repository folder.
    ruby methods/solutions/exercise_1.rb
```
