Statements and Iterations
--

These exercises are meant to be solved without the use of method definitions:

  **1. Filling an array with numbers:**
  - Write an iteration that fills an array with the numbers from 1 to 100.

  **2. FizzBuzz:**
  - Taking the numbers from 1 to 100:
    - Print "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3.
    - Print "Buzz" if the number is a multiple of 5.
    - Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.

  **3. Hash listing:**
  - Create a hash that will represent a shopping list.
    - The hash should have the following vegetables as keys and the amount to buy as values:
      Lettuce: 1
      Cucumber: 2
      Lemons: 6
      Potatoes: 10
      Tomatoes: 5
      Avocados: 2
    - Now add an iteration that prints this list to the screen.
    - Add a logic that would print a separate title if you need to buy more than or exactly five, like so:
      ```
      More than 5:
      - Lemons
      - Potatoes
      - Tomatoes
      ```
