Method Exercises
--

To solve the exercises, create a file for each exercise and run with ruby to get the result.

Each problem _can_ be solved with just one method, but not necessarily. In the end the solution should be printed to the screen with `puts`.

i.e:

```ruby
def my_method()
 # the logic of my method
end

puts my_method
```


## Exercises:

1. Write a method that receives one number and prints wether that number is an `even` or `odd` number.
2. Modify the previous method and print if the number is a `prime` number.
3. Write a method that prints all the numbers from `1 to 100`.
4. Modify the previous method and for `multiples of 3`, instead of the number, print `Fizz`, for `multiples of 5` print `Buzz`.
5. Write a method that receives two Arrays as parameters, merges them into one Array and prints the size of the merged Array.
6. Write a method that receives one Array as parameter, if the size of the Array is `lower than 10 elements`, print the array.
  + If `it’s bigger than 10 elements`, only take the `first 10 elements` and print the Array.
7. Write a method that takes 2 parameters, a `number` and an `operation`. The operation can be `“sum”` or `“multiply”`. Depending on the specified operation, calculate it from 1...`number`.
  + If I pass `3` as number and  `“sum”` as operation, the function should calculate `1+2+3`.
  + If I pass `3` as number and  `“multiply”` as operation, the function should calculate `1*2*3`.
8. Write a method that prints the `largest` element in an array, e.g. `[2, 5, 3, 1] -> 5`
9. Write method that prints the array but `reversed`, e.g. `[1, 2, 3] -> [3, 2, 1]`
10. Write a method that checks whether an `element occurs` in an array, e.g. `[2, 5, 4], 5 -> true`
11. Write a method that `combines two arrays` by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. `[a,b,c], [1,2,3] -> [a,1,b,2,c,3]`.
12. Write a method that calculates the list of the first `100 Fibonacci numbers`.
13. Write a method that takes a number (as string) and returns an array containing its digits, e.g. `"1234" -> ["1", "2", "3", "4"]`
14. Modify the previous method to receive the number as an `integer`, e.g. `567 -> [5, 6, 7]`
